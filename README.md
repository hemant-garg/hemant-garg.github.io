# react-redux-starter

**It is the Starter boilerplate for your next React project including redux, react-redux,react-router and sass. (all in one)**

Yaa I know, it takes time to just setup the whole react-redux and react-router flow in your react project. Thats why i created this simple boilerplate.
You just have to clone it on your system and boom.. no worries to all those setup.
